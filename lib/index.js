// create a tile object that will have a value and know its position
// create a canvas 4x4
// the canvas should know which grid space is empty or the god object that knows about everything (should not be canvas cause it does not care about what those tiles are)

// think about it as a linked list. each tile will have rlud the tile knows itself and the link to the right

// sell as a linked list/binary tree to employers!

// learning animation

// start with a canvas and make blocks line up next to each other

var canvas = document.findElementById("grid")
