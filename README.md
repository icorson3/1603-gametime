# Welcome to 1603 - A Turing Versioned 2048

## How to play:

- The game starts with two tiles, each has a value and is randomly placed.
- By using the arrow keys, a user will try to collide tiles together.
- When two tiles of the same value collide, they become one tile of double the value.
- Each time that an arrow is pressed, a new tile is created.
- The game ends when either all the tiles are full and no more moves can be made, or the game is played until one tile becomes "2048".
