// test scenario

// var board = new Board
// board is all set up
// assertions around what the board has
// board.registerChange()
// assertions that things you asserted earlier have changed

// Given a top row of 4 slots
// with the second slot having a 4
// and the third slot having a 4
// when a right motion is registered
// then I should have a top row of 4 slots
// where slot 1, 2 and 3 are empty
// and 4 is full
// and 4 has a value of 8

// Given a full board
// same scenerio
// same result

// Similar scenario with middle row

// Same scenario as first
// where numbers don't match
